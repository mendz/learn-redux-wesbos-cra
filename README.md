# My try to use updated dependencies for the course: Learn Redux by Wes Bos


- [LearnRedux](http://LearnRedux.com)
- [Learn-Redux-Starter-Files](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Redux-Starter-Files)

---

## Notes:

1. `src/reduxstagram.js` is `src/index.js`.

## Steps:

1. First I used the _styles_ `package.json` configuration from [Wes React-For-Beginners course](https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files/blob/master/catch-of-the-day/package.json).
2. Add the **Main** component, and use the styles.
3. Remove some files that we don't need.
4. Add hot reloading, from this article: "[Hot reloading with create-react-app without ejecting](https://medium.com/@brianhan/hot-reloading-cra-without-eject-b54af352c642)" by _Brian Han_.



## Things that are missing:

1.Can't renamed `index.js` to `reduxstagram.js` without eject.
